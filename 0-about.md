**The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie)** is a global leader in funding, producing, quality assuring and synthesising rigorous evidence. We support studies and reviews that examine what works, for whom, why and at what cost in low- and middle-income countries (L&MICs). We are also a global advocate for the generation and use of quality evidence in development decision-making.

3ie is a membership organisation with a global network of members and key partners.
